The point of this repo is just to have a simple portforlio that displays my Github repos. I didn't write the code, it's done by getting examples from StackOverflow, and AI. Just like my other repositories, this is also licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/Vaption/vaption.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT license</a>.
